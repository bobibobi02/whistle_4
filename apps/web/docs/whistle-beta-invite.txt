Hey! I’m testing a new minimalist social app called Whistle – it’s like a cleaner, loop-based version of Reddit.

Try it here:
https://whistle-p939tvjqh-bobibobis-projects.vercel.app/

It’s in public beta, so a few things may still be rough or slow, but the core flows should work:
- Create an account and log in
- Make a few posts with images + short context
- Comment, reply, upvote/downvote
- Save posts and then check the Saved tab

If something feels broken, confusing, or too slow, please tell me:
- what page you were on
- what you tried to do
- and what happened (error message / weird behavior).

Any feedback is super helpful at this stage.
